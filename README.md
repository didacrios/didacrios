# üåä Hi there

Passionate about leveraging technology for positive change, I am a self-taught programmer with a background in environmental health. My journey from environmental studies to software development fuels my commitment to creating impactful solutions that benefit individuals and society at large.

## üë®‚Äçüíª Coding Philosophy

My coding philosophy revolves around valuing people and their collaborative efforts over individual prowess. I firmly believe that effective teamwork and seamless collaboration are the keystones to exceptional software development. Embracing Extreme Programming (XP) principles ‚Äîsuch as communication, simplicity, feedback, respect, and courage‚Äî has been integral to my approach. These values not only foster a conducive environment for collective problem-solving but also ensure the delivery of high-quality, maintainable code and customer value. With a focus on fostering a culture of collaboration and shared responsibility, I try to integrate Lean and XP concepts to prioritize teamwork and people-centric and technical development practices in my coding endeavors.

## üî≠ Current Role

II currently work as a Senior Full Stack Developer at [Apricode Tech](https://github.com/Apricode-Tech-SL), where I'm part of a specialized team working with an external client ona comprehensive logistics application. Our primary focus involves migrating their legacy system to a modern, scalable solution using TypeScript and React. This challenging project allows me to apply my technical expertise while collaborating closely with stakeholders to ensure the new application meets their evolving business needs and improves operational efficiency. The migration process involves not only technological transformation but also streamlining workflows and enhancing user experience for logistics operations, making it a perfect blend of technical innovation and practical problem-solving.

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Track & Field

Beyond coding, I'm deeply engaged to Track & Field as both an athlete (M35) and a mentor for young athletes. My goal as a coach is to introduce them to the world of athletics while promoting healthy habits through sports that complement their education.

I like to have a taste of each track and field event, so I specialize in the combined events, I think it's the best option to introduce the little ones to athletics and that they can already choose when they're older
