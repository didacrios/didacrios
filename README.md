# 🌊 Hi there

Passionate about leveraging technology for positive change, I am a self-taught programmer with a background in environmental health. My journey from environmental studies to software development fuels my commitment to creating impactful solutions that benefit individuals and society at large.

## 👨‍💻 Coding Philosophy

My coding philosophy revolves around valuing people and their collaborative efforts over individual prowess. I firmly believe that effective teamwork and seamless collaboration are the keystones to exceptional software development. Embracing Extreme Programming (XP) principles —such as communication, simplicity, feedback, respect, and courage— has been integral to my approach. These values not only foster a conducive environment for collective problem-solving but also ensure the delivery of high-quality, maintainable code and customer value. With a focus on fostering a culture of collaboration and shared responsibility, I try to integrate Lean and XP concepts to prioritize teamwork and people-centric and technical development practices in my coding endeavors.

## 🔭 Current Role

I currently work at [Freshly Cosmetics](https://github.com/freshlycosmetics-developer) as part of a development team on an internal project aimed at streamlining daily operations at the logistics center responsible for processing and dispatching our orders. Our primary focus involves simplifying and automating the daily tasks of the logistics team, aiming to create more efficient workflows and enhance overall productivity

## 🏃‍♂️ Track & Field

Beyond coding, I'm deeply engaged to Track & Field as both an athlete (M35) and a mentor for young athletes. My goal as a coach is to introduce them to the world of athletics while promoting healthy habits through sports that complement their education.

I like to have a taste of each track and field event, so I specialize in the combined events, I think it's the best option to introduce the little ones to athletics and that they can already choose when they're older
